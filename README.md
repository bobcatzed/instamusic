Instamusic
==========

Spotify App that saves music you want to listen to for later.

Install
-------
Create (if you don't have it already) a directory called *Spotify* in your home directory.
Then check out this repo and put in a directory called *instamusic* in that folder. 

Note that you need to have the developer flag set on your Spotify account for this app to run.
Fore more info about this and how to install Spotify Apps, see the [Spotify Developer site](http://developer.spotify.com/).

Run
---

To run it, type 'spotify:app:instamusic' in the Search Box in the Spotify desktop client. This will start the app
and give you the choice to add it to your favourited apps.

Usage
-----

The basic idea of *Instamusic* is to be a place where you can put music you want to listen to some time in the (near) future.
It can be new music you found and want to check out, a bunch of old albums you want to listen to again or whatever.

That music, be it artists, albums, playlists or individual tracks, are than added to your Instamusic area as reminder notes.
To achieve this there are multiple ways.

* Inside Spotify you just drag'n'drop music into the app (more specifically onto the app icon in the left sidebar).
* From a your web browser, use the Instamusic bookmarklet to send music you want to save to your Spotify client.

To remove a note you simply click the X in the upper right corner.

Bookmarklet
-----------

To get started with the bookmarklet, go to the Bookmarklet tab and drag the *Listen Later* bookmarklet into your web browser
of choice and put it in your bookmarks bar. Whenever you find some music you want to save and listen to later you can now use
the bookmarklet.

As of now it has support for some well known music sites, for example Allmusic, Pitchfork and Last.fm (for a full list of
supported sites, see the Bookmarklet tab inside the app). On those sites all you have to do is click the bookmarklet, and
if a match is found in Spotify that artist, album or track will be saved. If no good enough match is found, it will be saved
as a search and hopefully the music might find its way into Spotify soon enough.

If you are on a page not supported by the bookmarklet, you are not entirely out of luck. You can then select some text
(i.e an artist and/or album) and it will be saved as a search to perform later in Spotify. 

When using the bookmarklet the web page that you found the music on will also be saved to the music note in the app,
so you easily can go back to the page and see what review or other information made you interrested in the first place.
